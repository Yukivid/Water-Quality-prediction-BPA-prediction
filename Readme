# Water Quality & BPA Prediction

An IoT-enabled system for real-time monitoring and analysis of water quality parameters, enhanced with Bisphenol A (BPA) contamination assessment. By integrating multiple sensors (pH, TDS, turbidity, etc.), microcontrollers, and a cloud-based platform, this project delivers accurate, real-time insights into water quality and potential BPA risks. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Overview

This project enables continuous monitoring of essential water quality metrics (pH, Total Dissolved Solids, turbidity) and uses predictive modeling to assess BPA contamination levels. Ideal for smart environmental surveillance and early warning detection in water safety.

## Features

- **Real-Time Sensor Monitoring**: Seamless data collection from pH, TDS, and turbidity sensors via microcontroller (e.g., ESP8266/NodeMCU).
- **BPA Prediction & Analysis**: Applies machine learning algorithms to determine BPA concentration risk based on collected metrics.
- **Cloud Integration**: Sensor data and BPA risk scores are transmitted to a cloud platform/dashboard for remote access and monitoring.
- **Alerts & Dashboard**: Visualization of metrics and alerts when water quality parameters exceed safety thresholds.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible with new sensor types or predictive models as needed.

## Tech Stack

- **Microcontroller**: ESP8266 / NodeMCU  
- **Sensors**: pH, TDS, Turbidity (expandable)  
- **Predictive Modeling**: (e.g., Python, Scikit-learn, any other frameworks you used)  
- **Cloud / Dashboard Platform**: (e.g., Firebase, AWS, Azure, or custom dashboards if used)  
- **Programming Languages**: (Arduino/C for microcontroller, Python for data processing, etc.)

<small>You can fill in specific libraries or frameworks used (e.g., `pandas`, `requests`, `matplotlib`, `flask`, etc.)</small>

## Architecture

1. **Sensor Data Capture**: Microcontroller reads water parameters and pre-processes raw signals.  
2. **Data Transmission**: Parameters sent to the cloud via Wi-Fi.  
3. **BPA Prediction**: Cloud-based script/database processes the data, generates BPA risk assessment.  
4. **Dashboard & Alerts**: Visualizes trends and triggers alerts when thresholds are crossed.
