## 🌟 Features

- 🧪 **Real-time Water Quality Monitoring**  
  Continuously measures **pH**, **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**, and **Turbidity** levels.  

- ⚗️ **BPA Contamination Prediction**  
  Uses machine learning to analyze sensor data and predict potential **BPA concentration risks**.  

- ☁️ **Cloud Integration**  
  Streams sensor data to a cloud dashboard for remote access and long-term tracking.  

- 🚨 **Alerts & Notifications**  
  Generates alerts when unsafe thresholds are detected in any parameter.

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection  
- pH, TDS, and Turbidity sensors connected to ESP8266/Arduino.  
- Data sampled continuously in real-time.  

### 2. Cloud Integration  
- Sensor values transmitted via Wi-Fi to a cloud dashboard.  

### 3. BPA Prediction Model  
- Machine learning model (trained using historical datasets).  
- Predicts probability of BPA contamination given sensor metrics.  

### 4. Alerts & Dashboard  
- Dashboard visualizes water quality trends.  
- Alerts triggered when **unsafe thresholds** or high BPA risk detected.
